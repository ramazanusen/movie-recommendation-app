# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a simple recommendation system designed to suggest movies based on user preferences. Using content-based filtering, the system recommends movies similar to those the user has enjoyed before. The project is built with Python and includes a web interface powered by Streamlit for ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Install any required packages using the `requirements.txt` file provided.

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

1. **Create the virtual environment** (in the root directory):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    On macOS/Linux:
        source myenv/bin/activate
    On Windows:
        myenv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies**:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Project

1. **Prepare the Data: Ensure the movies.csv file is located in the data/ directory.**

2. **Run the Web Application**:
    streamlit run src/app.py

3. **Using the Application: Enter a movie title in the app’s input box to receive a list of similar movies as recommendations.**

### Project Details

Data Preprocessing (src/data_preprocessing.py)
This module loads the dataset, removes unnecessary columns, handles missing values, and performs any other preprocessing required for the recommendation engine.

Recommendation Engine (src/recommendation_engine.py)
The core of the recommendation logic. Uses a content-based filtering approach to create similarity matrices and recommend movies based on user preferences.

Web Interface (src/app.py)
A simple Streamlit web application that provides an interactive UI for users to enter movie titles and view recommendations.

Configuration (src/config.py)
Contains any project-specific configurations, such as data paths and settings.

Future Improvements
    Potential enhancements include:

    Collaborative Filtering: Adding a collaborative filtering option for improved recommendations.

    Advanced Model Tuning: Experimenting with more advanced algorithms and optimizations.

    User Profiles: Allowing users to save preferences for a personalized experience.
